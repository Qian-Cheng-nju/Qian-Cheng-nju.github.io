I am Qian Cheng (程潜), a first-year PhD student in the Department of Computer Science at Nanjing University. My research focuses on formal methods on real-world systems, where I work on developing rigorous techniques to ensure the correctness and reliability of complex software systems.

## Research Interests

My primary research area is **formal methods for real-world systems**, especially model checking and specification-driven assurance. I am also exploring how **generative AI** can help create and refine formal specifications for complex computer systems. I am particularly interested in:
- Model checking and verification for large, evolving systems
- AI-assisted authoring and maintenance of formal specifications
- Generative AI techniques that bridge software engineering and formal methods
